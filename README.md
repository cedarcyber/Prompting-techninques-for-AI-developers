# Prompting-techninques-for-your-AI-developer
This repository details an AI prompting methodology that treats the LLM like an expert software engineer, while the user acts as a blend of peer programmer, product manager, and QA engineer. This leverages AI's ability to produce code at lightning speed and virtually no cost, enabling those with low code experience.

Below is a technique to prompt an LLM to help develop code (e.g., quick script, API spec, algorith, full fledged app). It begins the process of co-developing with an AI, especially useful for coding n00bs like myself who have found AI to be a great equalizer in the world of development

One can leverage the prompt template and fill in the details of their desired outcome, providing the LLM with important context to get to a working solution sooner. Works best with LLMs with large context windows

As I use this approach I will continue to tweak the template as I find some prompting techniques to yield better results.

The general flow that I follow...
